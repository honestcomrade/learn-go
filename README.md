## This is an amalgamation of all of my different attempts in the last 2 years to learn more about system programming in what is quickly becoming my favorite language - Golang.

Most of this work was inspired, taught by, or copied from a variety of teachers and coders who have posted their code. I have tried to attribute each sub-folder (which used to be its own repo) to the originator. 

Some of the work is my own, and most of it is cobbled together from a variety of these attributed resources.

### Project Goals: 
* Write more Test-driven web code using Golang
* Use more concurrency via Goroutines
* Master some interview-type algorithm problems using Golang
* Learn enough about Golang to start comfortably using it in a production web app environment
